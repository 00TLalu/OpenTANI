## Introduction
Open-source Project for Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) rice management practice developed by IRRI. The practice reduces water use by 30%   and also been proven to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, specifically methane (CH4), from rice production by 30-70%, without causing a yield reduction. For more information, please visit this link (http://books.irri.org/AWD_brochure.pdf). The goal of this project is brought Internet of Things (IoT) solution to helped farmers implement Alternate Wetting Drying (AWD) practice. 

## This project will divide into four(4) tasks.
1. Hardware
2. Software
3. Cloud Platform
4. Testing
